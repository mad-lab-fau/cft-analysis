Python package for the analysis of data collected during the Cold Face Test (CFT) study.

## Description

This package contains various helper functions to work with the dataset (including [`tpcp`](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/tpcp) `Dataset` representations) and to process data. Additionally, it contains different analysis experiments performed with the dataset.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

## Experiments
Currently, this repository contains the following experiments:

### 2022 – Scientific Reports
Analysis of the [CFT Dataset](https://mad-srv.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/MadLab/data/health-psychology/cold-face-test-data) for the paper "Exploring the Cold Face Test as a Mechanism for Reducing Acute Psychosocial Stress Responses", submitted to *Scientific Reports* [TODO: update when published].

#### Usage
In order to run the code, first download the [CFT Dataset](https://mad-srv.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/MadLab/data/health-psychology/cold-face-test-data). Then, create a file named `config.json` in the folder `/experiments/2022_scientific_reports` with the following content:
```json
{
    "base_path": "<path-to-dataset>"
}
```
This config file is parsed by all notebooks to extract the path to the dataset.   
**NOTE**: This file is ignored by git because the path to the dataset depends on the local configuration!

The files in the `data` folder are created by running the notebooks in the `data_processing` folder. The files in the `result` folder are created by running the notebooks in the `analysis` and the `plotting` folders.



## Installation

```bash
pip install cft-analysis
```
